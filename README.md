# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise, a prospective playwright, determine how to launch a successful kickstarter campaign for a play that she wants funded. She hopes to raise $10,000 during the course of the campaign and wants to know what factors lead to successful campaigns based off of data from other kickstarter campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### The two main factors that were analyzed to determine what makes a successful theatre kickstarter were the launch date and monetary goals of different campaigns. To perform this analysis, two different pivot tables were created to isolate these variables and display campaign outcomes (successful, failed and canceled) by campaign launch dates and goals. From these pivot tables two line graphs were created to visualize and interpret the results, which are attached below. Though no challenges were encountered during the process of this analysis, a potential challenge could be running into errors while manually creating the outcomes based on goals table with the COUNTIFS function.

## Results
- A conclusion that can be made about outcomes of theatre campaigns based on launch date is that more successful campaigns are launched between May-June, so it is reccomended that Louise launch her kickstarter then. Another conclusion is that the number of failed theatre campaigns remain relatively consistant throughout the year, so it cannot be assumed that the launch date of a kickstarter contributes to why a campaign would fail. 
- A conclusion that can be made about outcomes of campaigns based on monetary goal is that a campaign is more likely to be successful if the goal is set low, at around $1000-$5000. It is suggested that Louise lower her campaign goal to $5000 to increase the likelihood of success for her campaign. 
- Limitations of the kickstarter dataset include im not sure
- Other possible tables/graphs that could be created and interpreted to help Louise are outcomes based on duration of campaign, to see how long she should run her campaign for, and outcomes based on number of backers, to see how many people she needs to encourage to fund her play.
